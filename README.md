# Lab 2

This lab is an extention of lab 1, where we had to use the command line for a majority of
the steps. I learned how to use the command line to access controls on git such as respotories,
initialization, status, and etc. I was able to memorize most of the git command during this lab, 
and benefited me throughout the course.
